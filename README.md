# AlgoVisualizer

**AlgoVisualizer** is a web application that provides visual representations of algorithms, helping users understand how algorithms work step by step. Currently, it supports sorting and pathfinding algorithms.

### Sorting algorithms:
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Heap sort
- Quick sort
- Selection sort

### Pathfinding algorithms:
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A* search algorithm

The application is hosted online and can be accessed [here](https://algovisualization.vercel.app/).
